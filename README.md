# Tic-Tac-Toe: Player vs AI
Go head to head against a robot in an intense game of tic-tac-toe.

## Motivation
This repository was created mostly out of boredom.

## Difficulty Level
I intentionally made her beatable, so you definitely have a shot. I may implement an "impossible" game mode in the future that will result in a depressing amount of ties but what is the fun in that.

## How to play
You can initiate the game by running `python tictactoe_playervsai.py` on your command line (windows) or terminal (mac).
